R-D-F: how can I turn this into an exe for my coworkers to use

GitHub Copilot: You can turn your Tkinter Python script into an executable (.exe) using a tool called `PyInstaller`. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Install PyInstaller:
```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Build the executable:
```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```
- `--onefile` creates a single .exe file.
- `--windowed` prevents a console window from appearing (for GUI apps).

3. The .exe will be in the `dist` folder. Share this file with your coworkers.

GitHub Copilot: This error means PyInstaller is not installed or not available in your system PATH.

To fix this, run the following command in your PowerShell terminal:
```powershell
pip install pyinstaller
```

After installation, try running:
```powershell
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

If you still get the error, try running PyInstaller using Python:
```powershell
python -m PyInstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

R-D-F: will this make it so that all my imports such as tkinter work?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, using PyInstaller will package your script and all its required imports—including standard libraries like `tkinter`—into the executable. Your coworkers will not need to install Python or any packages; the .exe will include everything needed to run your GUI.

If you use any third-party libraries (not included with Python), make sure they are installed in your environment before running PyInstaller. For standard libraries like `tkinter`, no extra steps are needed.
